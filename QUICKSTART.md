# Quick Start Guide

Welcome! Here's how to get the most out of this tutoring guide.

## 🚀 First Time Here?

### Step 1: Understand the Philosophy (2 minutes)
This guide **does NOT give you complete solutions**. It teaches you **how to think** and **how to solve problems yourself**.

### Step 2: Check Your Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure you're comfortable with:
- Basic C++ syntax (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Basic arrays and strings
- Writing simple programs

If you're rusty on basics, review Chapters 1-8 of your textbook first.

### Step 3: Choose Your Starting Point

**If you're starting the course:**
→ Begin with [Classes](topics/01-classes.md)

**If you're struggling with a specific topic:**
→ Jump directly to that topic's guide

**If you want practice problems:**
→ Go to [Practice Problems](practice/README.md)

**If you need general resources:**
→ Check [Resources](resources/README.md)

## 📖 How to Use Each Topic Guide

Every topic guide follows this structure:

1. **📖 Conceptual Overview** - Read first to understand the "why"
2. **🎯 Core Concepts** - Study the pseudocode patterns
3. **💡 Step-by-Step Example** - See the thinking process in action
4. **🧪 Testing Ideas** - Learn what to test
5. **📊 Complexity Analysis** - Understand efficiency
6. **🎯 Practice Exercises** - Try these yourself!
7. **⚠️ Common Pitfalls** - Avoid these mistakes
8. **🚀 Implementation Challenge** - Now code it yourself!

### Recommended Workflow

```
1. Read Conceptual Overview (5-10 min)
   ↓
2. Study Core Concepts & Pseudocode (15-20 min)
   ↓
3. Work through Step-by-Step Example on paper (10-15 min)
   ↓
4. Think about edge cases (5 min)
   ↓
5. Try a practice exercise (30-60 min)
   ↓
6. Implement in C++ (30-90 min)
   ↓
7. Test thoroughly (15-30 min)
   ↓
8. Analyze complexity (5-10 min)
   ↓
9. Review common pitfalls (5 min)
```

**Total time per topic: 2-4 hours** (spread across multiple sessions)

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Recommended Sequence

**Week 1-2: Foundations**
- [Classes and Objects](topics/01-classes.md)
- [Dynamic Memory Management](topics/02-dynamic-memory.md)
- Practice: [Class Problems](practice/classes/problem-set-1.md)

**Week 3-4: Generic Programming**
- [Templates](topics/03-templates.md)
- Apply to previous topics

**Week 5-6: Data Structures**
- [Linked Lists](topics/04-linked-lists.md)
- [Stacks](topics/05-stacks.md)
- [Queues](topics/06-queues.md)
- Practice: [Linked List Problems](practice/linked-lists/problem-set-4.md)

**Week 7-8: Advanced Concepts**
- [Recursion](topics/07-recursion.md)
- [Algorithm Analysis](topics/08-algorithm-analysis.md)

### Alternative: Topic-Based Learning

Jump to topics as your course covers them:
- Match the topic guide to your current lecture
- Read the guide before or after class
- Do practice problems for homework

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Reading Pseudocode
1. **Don't skip it!** - The pseudocode teaches you to think algorithmically
2. **Trace by hand** - Walk through examples with pen and paper
3. **Convert to English** - Can you explain what it does in plain words?
4. **Draw diagrams** - Especially for data structures and memory

### For Implementation
1. **Start with pseudocode** - Don't code directly!
2. **Write header first** - Plan your class/function interface
3. **Implement incrementally** - One method at a time
4. **Test each piece** - Don't wait until everything is done
5. **Handle edge cases** - Empty, single element, maximum size

### For Practice Problems
1. **Read problem twice** - Make sure you understand
2. **List edge cases** - Before coding
3. **Write test plan** - Know how you'll verify
4. **Time yourself** - But focus on learning, not speed
5. **No peeking!** - Really try before looking for help

### For Getting Unstuck
1. **Reread conceptual overview** - Back to basics
2. **Draw it out** - Visualize the problem
3. **Simplify** - Solve smaller version first
4. **Take a break** - Walk away for 15 minutes
5. **Review similar example** - But don't copy!

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't copy code from online**
- You won't learn
- You'll struggle on exams
- It's academic dishonesty

❌ **Don't skip the thinking step**
- Going straight to code leads to bugs
- Pseudocode planning saves time

❌ **Don't ignore edge cases**
- Real programs must handle all inputs
- This is where bugs hide

❌ **Don't test only happy path**
- Test empty, single, full, invalid inputs
- Break your code intentionally

❌ **Don't rush through**
- Deep understanding > fast completion
- Quality > quantity

## 🏆 Success Metrics

You're making good progress when you can:

**Understanding (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] Explain concepts in your own words
- [ ] Draw diagrams for data structures
- [ ] Identify edge cases before coding

**Implementation (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] Write pseudocode without looking
- [ ] Convert pseudocode to C++ successfully
- [ ] Implement basic problems in one sitting

**Mastery (Week 5-8)**
- [ ] Design solutions to new problems
- [ ] Analyze complexity without hints
- [ ] Debug problems efficiently
- [ ] Help others understand concepts

## 🆘 Need More Help?

### Before Asking for Help
1. Review the topic guide thoroughly
2. Try the problem for at least 30 minutes
3. Review similar examples
4. Identify specifically where you're stuck

### When Asking for Help
✅ Good question: "I'm trying to implement insertAtEnd for linked list. My code compiles but the list doesn't print correctly. I think the issue is with pointer assignment, but I'm not sure which step is wrong. Here's my code..."

❌ Poor question: "My code doesn't work. Help!"

### Resources for Additional Help
- Course office hours
- Study groups (form one!)
- [Resources page](resources/README.md)
- Course discussion board

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

**Remember:**
- Struggling is part of learning
- Every expert was once a beginner
- Understanding > memorizing
- Practice > passive reading
- Your code should work, not just compile

**The goal isn't to finish quickly.**
**The goal is to understand deeply.**
