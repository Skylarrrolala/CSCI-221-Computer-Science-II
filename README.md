# CSCI 221 - Computer Science II Tutoring Guide

Welcome to the CSCI 221 tutoring repository for AUPP students! This repository serves as your companion for "Problem Solving with C++" (Chapters 9-18).

## 🎯 Tutoring Philosophy

This guide **does NOT provide complete code solutions**. Instead, it teaches you to:
- Think through problems systematically
- Design solutions using pseudocode
- Understand core concepts deeply
- Implement code yourself with confidence

## 📚 Core Topics (Chapters 9-18)

Each topic includes structured pseudocode, step-by-step reasoning, edge cases, complexity analysis, and test ideas:

1. **[Classes and Objects](topics/01-classes.md)** - Object-oriented programming fundamentals
2. **[Dynamic Memory Management](topics/02-dynamic-memory.md)** - Pointers, new/delete, memory safety
3. **[Templates](topics/03-templates.md)** - Generic programming and code reuse
4. **[Linked Lists](topics/04-linked-lists.md)** - Dynamic data structures
5. **[Stacks](topics/05-stacks.md)** - LIFO data structure and applications
6. **[Queues](topics/06-queues.md)** - FIFO data structure and applications
7. **[Recursion](topics/07-recursion.md)** - Recursive thinking and problem solving
8. **[Algorithm Analysis](topics/08-algorithm-analysis.md)** - Big-O notation and complexity

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

### For Each Topic:
1. **Read the conceptual overview** - Understand the "why"
2. **Study the pseudocode patterns** - Learn the "how"
3. **Review edge cases** - Think about boundary conditions
4. **Analyze complexity** - Understand performance implications
5. **Implement yourself** - Write actual C++ code
6. **Test thoroughly** - Use the provided test ideas

### Learning Path:
```
Start with Classes → Master Dynamic Memory → 
Learn Templates → Build Linked Lists →
Implement Stacks & Queues → Practice Recursion →
Analyze Algorithms
```

## 💡 Example: How This Guide Helps

**❌ What this guide does NOT do:**
```cpp
// Complete solution given to you
class Stack {
    // Full implementation here
};
```

**✅ What this guide DOES:**
```
PSEUDOCODE for Stack Push:
1. Check if stack is full (if using array)
2. Increment top pointer
3. Store element at top position
4. Handle edge cases (null stack, overflow)

YOUR TASK: Implement this in C++ yourself!
Test ideas: Empty stack, single element, full stack...
```

## 📋 Practice Problems

Check the [practice](practice/) directory for self-guided exercises organized by topic.

## 🎓 Study Tips

1. **Write pseudocode BEFORE coding** - Plan your solution
2. **Draw diagrams** - Visualize data structures
3. **Test edge cases** - Empty, single, full, null cases
4. **Analyze complexity** - Always ask "How efficient is this?"
5. **Code yourself** - No copy-paste learning!
