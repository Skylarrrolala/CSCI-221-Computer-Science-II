# Chapter 10: Defining Classes - Practice Problems

## Small Problems

**1. Simple Book Class**  
Create a Book class with private members for title and author. Add a constructor and getter methods. In main, create a few Book objects and print their info.

**2. Counter Class**  
Make a Counter class that starts at zero. Add methods to increment, decrement, reset to zero, and get the current value. Test it by counting up to 10 then back down to 0.

**3. Temperature Class**  
Build a Temperature class that stores degrees in Celsius. Add methods to set the temperature, get it in Celsius, and get it in Fahrenheit (F = C * 9/5 + 32).

**4. Circle Class**  
Create a Circle class with a private radius. Write methods to set the radius, calculate the area, and calculate the circumference. Test with multiple circles of different sizes.

**5. Student Class**  
Define a Student class with name and GPA. Include a constructor, getters, setters, and a method that returns true if the student is on the honor roll (GPA >= 3.5).

## Medium Problems

**1. Bank Account with Validation**  
Create a BankAccount class with balance, account number, and owner name. Implement deposit and withdraw methods that validate amounts (no negative deposits, can't withdraw more than balance). Track and display the number of transactions.

**2. Time Class**  
Build a Time class that stores hours, minutes, and seconds. Include methods to add seconds (with proper overflow to minutes/hours), subtract time, and display in HH:MM:SS format. Make sure values stay valid (0-23 for hours, 0-59 for minutes/seconds).

**3. Array-of-Objects Manager**  
Create a Product class (name, price, quantity). In main, create an array of 5 Product objects. Write functions (not class methods) to find the most expensive product, calculate total inventory value, and display all products sorted by price.
