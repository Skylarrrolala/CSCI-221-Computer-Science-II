# Chapter 11: Friends, Operators, Arrays in Classes - Practice Problems

## Small Problems

**1. Test Scores Class**  
Create a TestScores class with an array of 3 test scores. Provide methods to set a score at a specific index, get a score, and compute the average of all three tests.

**2. Overload Equality**  
Make a simple Point2D class (x, y coordinates). Overload the == operator to compare two points. Test by creating several points and checking if they're equal.

**3. Overload Addition for Vectors**  
Create a Vector2D class with x and y components. Overload the + operator to add two vectors component-wise. Print the result using a display method.

**4. Friend Function for Distance**  
Write a Point class with private x, y. Create a friend function that calculates the distance between two Point objects using the distance formula.

**5. Survey Results**  
Make a Survey class that tracks responses (1-5 stars) in an array of size 5. When someone rates, increment the count for that rating. Add a method to display a simple bar chart of the results.

## Medium Problems

**1. Inventory with Array**  
Create an Inventory class that stores up to 10 item names (array of strings) and their quantities (array of ints). Implement methods to add an item, remove an item, search by name, and display all items. Keep track of how many items are currently stored.

**2. Fraction Class with Operators**  
Build a Fraction class (numerator/denominator). Overload +, -, *, / operators for fraction arithmetic. Include a simplify method that reduces fractions to lowest terms. Overload << to print fractions nicely.

**3. Student Gradebook**  
Design a StudentRecord class that stores an array of assignment scores (up to 15). Add methods to add a score, drop the lowest score, calculate the weighted average (different weights for different assignments), and determine letter grade. Overload < and > to compare students by final grade.
