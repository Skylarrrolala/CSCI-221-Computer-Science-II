/*
 * Small Problem 1: Header and Implementation Files
 * 
 * Create a simple Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, and divide 
 * methods. Put the class declaration in calculator.h and the method 
 * implementations in calculator.cpp. Write a main.cpp that uses it.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is just the main.cpp file. You'll also need to create 
 * calculator.h and calculator.cpp separately.
