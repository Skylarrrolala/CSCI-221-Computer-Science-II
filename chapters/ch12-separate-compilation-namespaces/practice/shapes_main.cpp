/*
 * Small Problem 2: Multiple File Project
 * 
 * Split a simple program into three files: shapes.h (declarations for Circle 
 * and Square classes), shapes.cpp (implementations), and main.cpp (creates 
 * and uses the objects). Make sure to use include guards.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is just the main.cpp file. You'll also need shapes.h and shapes.cpp.
