# Chapter 13: Pointers and Linked Lists - Practice Problems

## Small Problems

**1. Build a 3-Node List**  
Manually create a linked list with exactly 3 nodes containing the values 100, 200, 300. Print all values by traversing the list.

**2. Count Nodes**  
Write a function that takes the head of a linked list and returns how many nodes are in the list. Test with lists of different sizes.

**3. Insert at Beginning**  
Create a function that inserts a new node at the very start of a linked list. The function should take the head pointer by reference and the value to insert.

**4. Search for Value**  
Write a function that searches a linked list for a specific value. Return true if found, false otherwise. Test by searching for values that exist and don't exist.

**5. Print in Reverse Order**  
Write a function that prints all values in a linked list in reverse order. You can use a recursive approach or build a temporary structure to help.

## Medium Problems

**1. Insert at End**  
Create a function that adds a new node to the end of a linked list. Make sure it works when the list is empty and when it already has nodes. Test by building a list one element at a time.

**2. Delete by Value**  
Write a function that removes the first node with a specific value from the list. Handle cases where the value is at the head, in the middle, at the end, or not found at all. Don't forget to free the deleted node's memory.

**3. Merge Two Sorted Lists**  
Given two sorted linked lists, write a function that merges them into one sorted linked list. You can create new nodes or reuse existing ones—just make sure to link everything correctly and handle memory properly.
