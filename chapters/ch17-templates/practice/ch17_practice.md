# Chapter 17: Templates - Practice Problems

## Small Problems

**1. Generic Maximum**  
Write a template function that takes two values of any type and returns the larger one. Test it with int, double, and string.

**2. Generic Array Print**  
Create a template function that prints all elements of an array. It should work with arrays of int, double, char, or string. Test with different types and sizes.

**3. Generic Swap**  
Write a template function that swaps two variables of any type. Verify it works by swapping integers, doubles, and strings.

**4. Triple Template**  
Make a template function that takes a value and returns triple that value (multiply by 3). Test with different numeric types to see how it behaves.

**5. Template Pair Class**  
Create a template class Pair that holds two values of the same type. Add methods to get and set both values. Test with Pair<int>, Pair<double>, and Pair<string>.

## Medium Problems

**1. Generic Array Min/Max**  
Write two template functions: one that finds the minimum and one that finds the maximum in an array of any comparable type. Test with arrays of different types and verify they work correctly.

**2. Simple Stack Template**  
Build a Stack template class that can store any type. Implement push, pop, peek, and isEmpty methods using an internal array of fixed size (like 100). Test with stacks of different types (int, string, etc.).

**3. Generic Pair with Different Types**  
Create a Pair template class that can hold two values of DIFFERENT types (use two template parameters). Add methods to get first, get second, and swap the pair. Test with combinations like <int, string>, <double, char>, etc.
