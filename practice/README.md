## 🎯 How to Use These Problems

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Understand requirements fully
2. **Think before coding** - Write pseudocode first
3. **Consider edge cases** - What could go wrong?
4. **Implement step by step** - Don't try to write it all at once
5. **Test thoroughly** - Use the provided test ideas
6. **Analyze complexity** - What's the Big-O?
7. **Refactor if needed** - Can you make it clearer or more efficient?

## 📊 Difficulty Levels

- 🟢 **Easy**: Fundamental concepts, straightforward implementation
- 🟡 **Medium**: Requires combining concepts, moderate complexity
- 🔴 **Hard**: Advanced problem-solving, optimization needed

## 💡 Study Tips

- Start with Easy problems to build confidence
- Don't spend more than 30-45 minutes stuck - review the topic guide
- Draw diagrams for data structures
- Write test cases before implementing
- Compare your solution complexity with optimal solution
